# Michael's ESLint configuration

This replaces [eslint-configs](https://github.com/MichaelKohler/eslint-configs) to simplify everything. This configuration intentionally won't cover all the cases the old repo covered. The initial configuration was taken from the old repository, and therefore also includes parts from @freaktechnik's configuration.
